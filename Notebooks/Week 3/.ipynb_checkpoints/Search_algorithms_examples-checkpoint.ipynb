    "One of the simplest search algorithms is *linear search*. The algorithm begins at one end of the list (or data structure) and checks each element until it finds the correct element or it reaches the end of the list. We can think of a linear search algorithm as an enhanced implementation of the Python `in` operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially, the linear search algorithm iterates over the list and returns the index of the first occurrence of the searched element when it is found. If there is more than one occurrence of the searched element, a basic linear search function will only return the index of the first occurrence because the other occurrences are not even considered. In other words, the algorithm terminates when it finds an occurrence of the searched element.\n",

    "In the first example below, we see a list `[11, 2, 26, 18, 23]` in which we are searching for an element with the value `[18]`. We step through the first three elements before finding the first occurrence of the searched item, at which time the function will return the index and terminate. \n",

This search algorithm **iterates through each element** in the list using a `for loop`. Within this loop, an if statement checks whether the **current element is equal to the target element** that the search is trying to locate. If a match is found, the procedure promptly **returns the index** of the identified element. In the event that the entire list is traversed without finding the target element, the procedure concludes by **returning a signal denoting that the element was not found** in the list. \n",

    "Consider the first list in the figure above, `[11, 2, 26, 18, 23]`, but now we want to find `[23]`, which is the last element in the list. The algorithm would have to iterate through every element until the last one before returning something, which is equal to the number of elements in the list. Similarly, if the value we would like to find is not included in the list, we would still have to iterate as many times as there are elements in the list.\n",

The *best-case time complexity* is then *constant time*, $O(1)$, when the searched item is the first element in the list.\n",

So, with each additional divide, we have half the number of elements to search through for the target element. However, this means that the input list **must be sorted** for a binary search technique to work efficiently.\n",

    "\n",
    "In a recursive implementation, say `binary_search_recur(items, target)`, the first recursion would have `[5]` at index 4 as the *midpoint*.\n",
    "\n",
    " i.e `len(items)//2` $= 8//2 = 4$. \n",
    " \n",
    " Since this midpoint is smaller than the target, we only consider the right side (including the midpoint) of the input list on the second recursion `binary_search_recur(items[mid:], target)`. However, the indexes have now changed because the recursive function only \"sees\" the right half of the input list. To find the correct index relating to the initial input list, we need to add the resulting index from the second recursion to the midpoint index.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Iterative implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "In an *iterative implementation*, say `binary_search_iter(items, target)`, the first iteration would have `[4]` as the midpoint because we initialise the start and end values rather than the number of items to calculate its index: \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\textbf{midpoint} = (\\text{start} + \\text{end})//2$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\textbf{midpoint} = (0 + (\\text{len(items)} - 1))//2$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\textbf{midpoint} = (0 + (8 - 1))//2$ \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\textbf{midpoint} = 7//2$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\textbf{midpoint} = 3$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Since this midpoint is not equal to and smaller than the target value of `[7]`, the new start value is at index 4, the midpoint at index 5, and the end value at index 7. Again, as the midpoint is not equal to and still smaller than the target value, the new start value is at index 6, the midpoint is also at index 6, and the end value at index 7. Since the midpoint is now equal to the target value, we can return and terminate.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, for the same list and target value, the recursive implementation had to divide twice, while the iterative implementation had to divide three times. Considering the same list but changing the target value to `[2]` results in three recursions but only two iterations, as observed in the figure below.\n",
