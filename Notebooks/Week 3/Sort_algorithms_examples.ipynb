    "Applying sorting techniques is especially useful in the following cases:\n",
    "* **Searching** algorithms are much quicker on sorted lists.\n",
    "* **Selecting** items based on a specific characteristic, such as the k<sup>th</sup> smallest or largest value.\n",
    "* **Finding duplicates** in a list is much easier if sorted.\n",

    "- An **in-place** sorting algorithm refers to one that sorts the input using no additional data structures. In other words, the sorting algorithm modifies the input list directly instead of creating a new list for the sorted output. The in-place characteristic often indicates the space complexity of an algorithm.\n",

    "- A **stable** sorting algorithm refers to one that leaves list elements that have equal sorting keys at the *same relative positions* as they were in the input list. So, a stable algorithm preserves the original order of the input list. If we had duplicate elements in the list, the output list would contain these duplicate elements in the same relative order.\n",

    "**a) Best case**\n",
    "\n",
    "From the previous figure, we can already deduce that our best-case time complexity will occur when the (sub)lists are split into two equal parts, or if the **pivot element is the median value**.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we split the lists into halves, as in merge sort, then we again only require one additional recursion for every doubling of the number of list elements. Therefore, as in merge sort, the **best-case** time complexity of our division stages is $\\log_2 n$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, the addition of the various sublists is ***linear time complexity* $n$**, as addition always is. This leaves us with an **overall *best-case time complexity* that is *linearithmic time***, $O(n \\log n)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**a) Average case**\n",
    "\n",
    "Deriving the **average** time complexity is slightly more complicated, but we can still assume an **overall *average time complexity* that is *linearithmic time***, $O(n \\log n)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**a) Worst case**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **worst-case** time complexity would occur if the **pivot element is always the largest or smallest element of the list(sub_list)**. This means that the sublists would not be of equal length since one sublist would have zero elements and the other $n-1$ elements. \n",
    "\n",
    "The division effort would decrease with each level, in other words, $n-1$, $n-2$, $n-3$, ..., $0$. Therefore, with $n$ division levels and effort $1/2 n$ (and $n$ number of elements): $n \\times 1/2 n = 1/2 n^2$, our **overall *worst-case time complexity* is *quadratic*, $O(n^2)$**."
