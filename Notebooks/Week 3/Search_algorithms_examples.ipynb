    "One of the simplest search algorithms is *linear search*. The algorithm begins at one end of the list (or data structure) and checks each element until it finds the correct element or it reaches the end of the list. We can think of a linear search algorithm as an enhanced implementation of the Python `in` operator.\n",

If there is more than one occurrence of the searched element, a basic linear search function will only return the index of the first occurrence because the other occurrences are not even considered. In other words, the algorithm terminates when it finds an occurrence of the searched element.\n",

If a match is found, the procedure promptly **returns the index** of the identified element. In the event that the entire list is traversed without finding the target element, the procedure concludes by **returning a signal denoting that the element was not found** in the list. \n",

So, with each additional divide, we have half the number of elements to search through for the target element. However, this means that the input list **must be sorted** for a binary search technique to work efficiently.\n",

    "\n",
    "In a recursive implementation, say `binary_search_recur(items, target)`, the first recursion would have `[5]` at index 4 as the *midpoint*.\n",
    "\n",
    " i.e `len(items)//2` $= 8//2 = 4$. \n",
    " \n",
    " Since this midpoint is smaller than the target, we only consider the right side (including the midpoint) of the input list on the second recursion `binary_search_recur(items[mid:], target)`. However, the indexes have now changed because the recursive function only \"sees\" the right half of the input list. To find the correct index relating to the initial input list, we need to add the resulting index from the second recursion to the midpoint index.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Iterative implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "In an *iterative implementation*, say `binary_search_iter(items, target)`, the first iteration would have `[4]` as the midpoint because we initialise the start and end values rather than the number of items to calculate its index: \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\textbf{midpoint} = (\\text{start} + \\text{end})//2$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\textbf{midpoint} = (0 + (\\text{len(items)} - 1))//2$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\textbf{midpoint} = (0 + (8 - 1))//2$ \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\textbf{midpoint} = 7//2$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\textbf{midpoint} = 3$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Since this midpoint is not equal to and smaller than the target value of `[7]`, the new start value is at index 4, the midpoint at index 5, and the end value at index 7. Again, as the midpoint is not equal to and still smaller than the target value, the new start value is at index 6, the midpoint is also at index 6, and the end value at index 7. Since the midpoint is now equal to the target value, we can return and terminate.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, for the same list and target value, the recursive implementation had to divide twice, while the iterative implementation had to divide three times. Considering the same list but changing the target value to `[2]` results in three recursions but only two iterations, as observed in the figure below.\n",

In the experiment, we will generate lists of varying lengths and observe the time it takes to locate an element within the list.\n",

    "The time complexity graphs generated from the two search algorithms highlight the stark difference in compute times, with binary search clearly showing to be more efficient than your normal linear search. Since the binary search is logarithmic ($O(\\log n)$) in nature, it is important to notice that as the size of the list doubles, the time taken to find an element only increases by a fraction. This is because after doubling the size of the list, the algorithm will only take one additional iteration to find the required element. \n",
    "\n",
    "As much as the binary search performs better than the linear search, the order of the items in the list is what makes the method efficient. Given a list in random order, it would be futile to try and perform a binary search on the list. However, the linear search does not require the items to be in any order, seeing as it will sequentially sweep through the entire list, so it is always guaranteed to find the element in linear time ($O(n)$). This is the one major advantage that linear search has over its binary counterpart."
